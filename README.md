- 👋 Hi, I’m @InnaLysienko 🇺🇦
- 👀 I’m deeply interested in mastering the Full Stack development process, from front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to back-end frameworks like Node.js, Python Django, or Ruby on Rails. 
I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of creating seamless user experiences while ensuring the reliability and scalability of the underlying systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into learning the ins and outs of full stack development, focusing on mastering both front-end and back-end technologies. 
🤓I'm immersing myself in courses, tutorials, and projects to build a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various back-end frameworks. 
  I'm excited 😊 to continually expand my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  projects that allow me to apply my growing skills in full stack development. 
  Whether it's building web applications, developing APIs, or optimizing database performance, 
  I'm excited to work with a team that values creativity, collaboration, and continuous learning

- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting in the kitchen with new recipes.👩🏼‍🍳
 🥗I love the creative process of cooking and often draw parallels between crafting a dish and writing code. 🥘🧆
 ✨Just like in programming, precision, attention to detail, and a willingness to experiment are key ingredients for success!✨
